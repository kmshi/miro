"""Customized site-setup script that leaves sys.path alone.

In a normal Python implementation, this module is automatically
imported at startup, and sets up sys.path using various heuristics,
and then does incidental other platform-dependent, heuristic-based
initialization.

We want sys.path to be exactly one entry, so I've stripped out
everything that has to do with augumenting sys.path and for the most
part left the other incidental initializations alone. One exception to
the first part of that sentence is that the logic for dealing with
.pth files has been left alone, just in case.

In any event, this is the very first Python code that runs.
