'platform/<platform name>' -- platform-specific code. This is searched
first when importing Python modules.

'portable' -- the portable backend that is common across all platforms.

'resources' -- cross-platform resource files distributed with the
application. Includes GUI assets that are (or could be) shared across
platforms, but not those that are specific to a particular widget set.
