    """System wide signals for Miro.  These can be accessed from the singleton
    object signals.system.  Signals include:

    "error" - A problem occurred in Miro.  The frontend should let the user
        know this happened, hopefully with a nice dialog box or something that
        lets the user report the error to bugzilla.  

        Arguments:
        - report -- string that can be submitted to the bug tracker
        - exception -- Exception object (can be None)

    "startup-success" - The startup process is complete.  The frontend should
        wait for this signal to show the UI to the user.
        
        No arguments.

    "startup-failure" - The startup process fails.  The frontend should inform
        the user that this happened and quit.
        
        Arguments:
        - summary -- Short, user-friendly, summary of the problem
        - description -- Longer explanation of the problem

    "shutdown" - The backend has shutdown.  The event loop is stopped at this
    point.

    "loaded-custom-channels" - We loaded the initial channels from an OPML
        file.

    "update-available" - A new version of Miro is available.
     
        Arguments:
        - rssItem -- The RSS item for the latest version (in sparkle
          appcast format).

    "download-complete" - An item has finished downloading.
    
        Arguments:
        - item -- The object that finished downloading.
