"""app.py -- Stores singleton objects.

App.py is a respository for high-level singleton objects.  Most of these
objects get set in startup.py, but some get set in frontend code as well.

Here is the list of objects that app currently stores:

controller -- Handle High-level control of Miro
db -- Database object

The html frontend adds:

delegate -- UIBackendDelegate that handles platform-specific UI tasks.
htmlapp -- HTMLApplication object
"""

# NOTE: we could set controller, db, etc. to None here, but it seems better
# not do.  This way if we call "from miro.app import controller" before the
# controller singleton is created, then we will immediately get an error.
