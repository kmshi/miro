Holds functions that return import directories and other platform-oriented
functions.

.. Note::

   Some of these functions are probably not absolutely correct in the
   face of funny characters in the input paths. In particular,
   :fun:`url` doesn't DTRT when the path contains spaces. But they
   should be sufficient for resolving resources, since we have control
   over the filenames.
