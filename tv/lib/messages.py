"""``miro.messages`` -- Message passing between the frontend thread
and the backend thread.

The backend thread is the eventloop, which processes things like feed
updates and handles reading and writing to the database.  The frontend
thread is the thread of the UI toolkit we're using.  Communication
between the two threads is handled by passing messages between the
two.  These messages are handled asynchronously.

This module defines the messages that are passed between the two
threads.
