This is the source for Miro, the client-side component of
the Democracy platform for Internet TV.  It is targeted at average,
unsophisticated Internet users with broadband connections.  It can be
built for Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, or X Windows-based platforms
such as Linux, with a native look and feel on each platform.  There
is a clean separation between the portable backend and the
platform-specific frontend in the event that new ports are desired in
the future.  

It is written primarily in Python and is distributed under the terms 
of the GNU General Public License; see license.txt.
